1. Documentation

The IRS is a summary of a institution's HMDA submission to be used by the filing institution to confirm that they are submitting the correct data.

As such, access to each IRS is restricted to users associated with the institution. Users must be authenticated using the HMDA authentication system and include a bearer token with their request.

(More information on authentication can be found above in the [Authorization section](https://cfpb.github.io/hmda-platform/#hmda-platform-filing-api-authorization) in the HMDA Platform Filing API section of these docs)

## Direct S3 File Service

All other files are accessed through direcnt links to the HMDA Platform's public S3 bucket.

These S3 links are all prefixed with: `<%= config[:s3api] %>`. The list of available files can be found at ffiec.cfpb.gov.
