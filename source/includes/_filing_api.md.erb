# HMDA Filing

The following documentation addresses the process for filing a HMDA file and the associated APIs.

This API is what powers the [HMDA Filing Platform application](https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/filing/)

## Authorization

To file HMDA data using the API, an _bearer_ authorization token is required for all api calls. To acquire an authorization token use the `/auth` endpoint with your username and password as payload.

For local development, no authorization is needed. See [One-line Local Development Environment (No Auth)](https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-platform#one-line-local-development-environment-no-auth) for more info.

> Example Request

  ```shell
  curl -X POST \
  "<%= config[:authhost] %>/auth/realms/hmda2/protocol/openid-connect/token" \
  -d 'client_id=hmda2-api&grant_type=password&username={{username}}%40{{bank_domain}}&password={{password}}'
  ```

 | |
---|---
Method  |  `POST`
URL | `<%= config[:authhost] %>/auth/realms/hmda2/protocol/openid-connect/token`
Payload  | client_id=hmda2-api <br> grant_type=password <br> username={{username}}%40{{bank_domain}} <br> password={{password}}

## Postman Collection

The [HMDA Postman Collection](https://github.com/cfpb/hmda-platform/tree/master/newman/postman) has been prepared to simplify the process of using the HMDA Platform Filing APIs.

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/) is a client side application that allows users to easily construct API calls and import external API collections.

## Filing Process

Submission of a HMDA file flows in the following steps which are mirriored in the submission status codes:

1. Create a Filing: These are unique per institution per filing season and are created by the HMDA-Ops teams in preperation for each filing season.
1. Create a Submission: Submissions are the primary object in a HMDA Filing. They are created within a filing and each is able to accept a single file upload. Many submissions can be created for a filing and they carry an id which is incrimented.
1. Upload a File: A file is then uploaded to the submission which was created. Only one file can be uploaded to a submission. To upload a new file you must create a new submission.
1. Check the status of the Submission the file was uploaded to: If parsing syntactical or validity edits are triggered a new file must be uploaded.
1. Validate Quality Edits: Review triggered Quality Edits and confirm the submitted data are correct.
1. Validate Macro Edits: Review triggered Macro Edits and confirm the submitted data are correct.
1. Sign the Submission: Perform final review of the data and complete the HMDA filing.

### Submission Status

As a submission represents a HMDA filing the submission status is the best way to see the state of a HMDA filing. It will be useful to query for 
the submission status often throughout the process of uploading and checking edits for a submission.

#### Submission Status Codes

> JSOn Status Code Example

```json
{
  "id": {
    "lei": "12345abc",
    "period": "2018",
    "sequenceNumber": 3
  },
  "status": {
    "code": 1,
    "message": "No data has been uploaded yet.",
    "description": "The filing period is open and available to accept HMDA data. Make sure your data is in a pipe-delimited text file."
  },
  "start": 0,
  "end": 0,
  "fileName": "test.txt",
  "receipt": ""
}
```

In order to track the status of a filing for a financial institution, the following states are captured by the backend:

Code | Message | Description
--- | --- | ---
1 | No data has been uploaded yet. | The filing period is open and available to accept HMDA data. Make sure your data is in a pipe-delimited text file.
2 | Your file is uploading. | Your file is currently being uploaded to the HMDA Platform.
3 | Your file has been uploaded. | Your data is ready to be analyzed.
4 | Checking the formatting of your data. | Your file is being analyzed to ensure that it meets formatting requirements specified in the HMDA Filing Instructions Guide.
5 | Your data has formatting errors. | Review these errors and update your file. Then, upload the corrected file.
6 | Your data is formatted correctly. | Your file meets the formatting requirements specified in the HMDA Filing Instructions Guide. Your data will now be analyzed for any edits.
7 | Your data is being analyzed. | Your data has been uploaded and is being checked for any edits.
8 | Your data has been analyzed for Syntactical and Validity Errors. | Your file has been analyzed and does not contain any Syntactical or Validity errors.
9 | Your data has syntactical and/or validity edits that need to be reviewed. | Your file has been uploaded, but the filing process may not proceed until the file is corrected and re-uploaded.
10 | Your data has been analyzed for Quality Errors. | Your file has been analyzed, and does not contain quality errors.
11 | Your data has quality edits that need to be reviewed. | Your file has been uploaded, but the filing process may not proceed until edits are verified or the file is corrected and re-uploaded.
12 | Your data has been analyzed for macro errors. | Your file has been analyzed, and does not contain macro errors.
13 | Your data has macro edits that need to be reviewed. | Your file has been uploaded, but the filing process may not proceed until edits are verified or the file is corrected and re-uploaded.
14 | Your data is ready for submission. | Your financial institution has certified that the data is correct, but it has not been submitted yet.
15 | Your submission has been accepted. | This completes your HMDA filing process for this year. If you need to upload a new HMDA file, the previously completed filing will not be overridden until all edits have been cleared and verified, and the new file has been submitted.
-1 | An error occurred while submitting the data. | Please re-upload your file.

## Endpoints

### Start a Filing

For evey filing period, you must begin by starting a filing. This only needs to be done once per filing season. In the production HMDA filing application this will have already been creaed. 
The `POST` will result in a `200` only for the first time it's called. If the filing for the given filing period already exists, the `POST` will return a `400`.

```shell
curl -X POST \
