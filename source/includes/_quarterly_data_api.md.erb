 Method  |  `GET`
 URL | `<%= config[:quarterlydataapi] %>/{endpoint}`
 Return  |  JSON

To get the specific graph data, append the `endpoint` value from the above [Graph Data Summary](#quarterly-data-graph-api-quarterly-data-endpoints-graph-data-summary) section example response to the base url of `<%= config[:authhost] %>/quarterly-data/graphs/`,
e.g. `<%= config[:quarterlydataapi] %>/applications`.

The response contains the following sections:

  * title
  
  * subtitle

  * series

  * xLabel

  * yLabel

`title`, `subtitle`, `xLabel`, and `yLabel` are text fields providing some contexts of what the data represents.

`series` section is a list of data representing each line within the graph; each element within `series` will include xy `coordinates`, and `name` of the line.
In general, the x `coordinates` represents the time period (e.g. `2021-Q3`), y `coordinates` are numeric values.
