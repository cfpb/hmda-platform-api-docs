# HMDA API Documentation

The HMDA Platform APIs can be used to prepare, test, and file your HMDA data by allowing you to calculate rate spread, check a single LAR for formatting errors, generate/validate a check digit, and more.
Additionally the Data Browser APIs can be used to query the published HMDA data to download subsets of the data or generate aggregations.
